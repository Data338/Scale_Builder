# ðŸŽ¹ Terminal Scale Explorer

A little project I made to help visualize musical scales straight from the terminal. You input a root note, and it spits out the chromatic intervals in that key â€” both sharp and flat variations supported.

This was built as part of my studies, but also because I wanted a fast way to reference theory stuff while jamming or composing. Iâ€™m keeping things simple and terminal-based for now, but might expand it later.

## âœ¨ Features

- Handles sharp and flat input (`C#`, `Eb`, `Bb`, etc.)
- Displays semitone distances and common names (Major 3rd, Minor 6th, etc.)
- Recognizes enharmonic equivalents
- Full chromatic interval map up to the 13th

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then just run it from terminal:

```bash
python scale_explorer.py
