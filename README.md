ðŸŽ¹ Terminal Scale Explorer

A CLI tool to visualize and explore a wide variety of musical scales directly in your terminal.
You input a root note, pick a scale, and the program generates all notes in that scale â€” supporting both sharp and flat variations.

Originally built as part of my music theory studies, but also as a quick reference while jamming or composing. Itâ€™s simple, fast, and purely terminal-based for now, but future plans might include more interactive or visual features.

ðŸ”® Future Improvements

    Refactoring for better readability and performance.

    Potential addition of chord generation and modal interchange.

    Maybe even a TUI (Text User Interface) version for smoother navigation.
